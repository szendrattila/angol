      <h5 class="w3-center">Since 1928</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Skeleton is a winter sliding sport in which a person rides a small sled, known as a skeleton bobsled (or -sleigh), down a frozen track while lying face down and head-first. The sport and the sled may have been named from the bony appearance of the sled.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Unlike other sliding sports of bobsleigh and luge, the race always involves single riders. Like bobsleigh, but unlike luge, the race begins with a running start from the opening gate at the top of the course. The skeleton sled is thinner and heavier than the luge sled, and skeleton gives the rider more precise control of the sled. Skeleton is the slowest of the three sliding sports, as skeleton's face-down, head-first riding position is less aerodynamic than luge's face-up, feet-first ride.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">General information about the sport</h1><br>
      <h4>The sport was invented in Switzerland.</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Skeleton was born in the winter sport mecca of St. Moritz, Switzerland. According to Thrillist, the creepy-sounding name may come from the fact that the sled is so thin that it resembles an actual human skeleton.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Skeleton is much more complicated than just throwing yourself down a hill</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">OK, at the end of the day, it is technically throwing yourself down a hill. But sliders train to give themselves advantages, which are crucial as races are usually won by a few hundredths of a second</p><br>
    
      <h4>The U.S. has won the most skeleton medals of any country</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Twenty-one nations sent skeleton teams to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Seven of those nations (Belgium, China, Ghana, Jamaica, Netherlands, Nigeria, and Ukraine) are first-time Olympic skeleton entrants. As for Team USA, Thrillist reports that we have the most Olympic medals in skeleton of any country competingâ€”eight in total, three of which are gold.</p><br>
